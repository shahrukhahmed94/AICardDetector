## Installation

Follow these steps to integrate the AI Card Detector library into your Android project.

### Step 1: Add the JitPack Repository

In your root `build.gradle` file, add the JitPack repository at the end of the `repositories` section:

```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

 This will allow you to access dependencies hosted on JitPack.

### Step2: Add the Dependency

In your app's build.gradle file, add the following dependency:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.shahrukhahmed94:AICardDetector:1.0.3'
}
```

Make sure you sync your project with Gradle after adding the dependency to complete the integration.
